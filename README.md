 A user named Karen initiates a support request by opening a new ticket through the osTicket system

This marks the beginning of the ticket lifecycle and logs Karen’s issue into the help desk support queue..</p>

<h3 align="center">Assignment and Communication</h3>

  Once the ticket is submitted, a support agent, John Doe, logs into the help desk dashboard to check for new and existing tickets requiring attention.


Upon reviewing the submitted ticket, Agent John Doe begins the initial assessment and prepares to handle or delegate the issue.</p>

  Upon examining the ticket details, Agent John determines it is a Severity-A (Sev-A) emergency, indicating a critical issue requiring immediate intervention.</p>

Realizing that the issue is beyond his scope or requires specialized expertise, he decides to escalate the ticket by reassigning it to a System Administrator. Before transferring it, he ensures that proper internal notes and communication are added to maintain clarity for the next handler.</p>

The reassigned ticket is received by System Administrator Jane Doe, who logs into her portal to take over the issue.</p>

Jane reviews all existing notes, investigates the cause, applies the necessary fixes, and provides a detailed update within the system. After resolving the issue, she changes the status of the ticket from ‘Open’ to ‘Resolved’. Ensuring it reflects that the problem

  <h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>

  Back on his dashboard, Agent John observes that Jane has completed the task and left an update. He verifies the message and confirms the issue has been resolved. The ticket is now marked as closed in the system.

  This example illustrates a ticket lifecycle from user submission to resolution, with key interactions among support staff. It showcases how a ticket moves through stages of assignment, escalation, collaboration, and closure.
 
The lifecycle of a ticket may involve more complex paths, reassigning the ticket to different departments or tiers based on specialization, escalating the severity level if the problem is of high impact, and routing the ticket to more experienced agents.

Support agents may handle anywhere from 10 to 100 tickets per day, depending on the size and demands of the company. A clear understanding of the ticket lifecycle enables better communication, faster resolutions, and improved customer satisfaction.
