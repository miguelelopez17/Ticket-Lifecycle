<br />
<p>
  Once the ticket is submitted, a support agent, John Doe, logs into the help desk dashboard to check for new and existing tickets requiring attention.


Upon reviewing the submitted ticket, Agent John Doe begins the initial assessment and prepares to handle or delegate the issue.</p>

  Upon examining the ticket details, Agent John determines it is a Severity-A (Sev-A) emergency, indicating a critical issue requiring immediate intervention.</p>

Realizing that the issue is beyond his scope or requires specialized expertise, he decides to escalate the ticket by reassigning it to a System Administrator. Before transferring it, he ensures that proper internal notes and communication are added to maintain clarity for the next handler.</p>
